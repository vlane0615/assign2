        <h2>Work Breakdown</h2>
        <p>
            Since graduating from her undergraduate degree in 2012, Vanessa
            has had several different jobs that revolve around education, technology,
            strategy, and even tacos. In interviews, Vanessa often is asked why her
            work history is all over the place. The main reason for this is because Vanessa's husband,
            Marcus, is a Lutheran pastor. This means that the couple has been sent all over the 
            U.S. for internships and jobs related to Marcus's career. While it's very exciting, it has 
            made for an interesting work history for Vanessa. Fortunately, it looks like the Lane 
            family is sticking around Ann Arbor, MI, for a while.
